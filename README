This is a simple 3D math module and some code that uses it to render objects in a
Tkinter Canvas and move them around in 3D.

It's still in a rough state, although it works. I'll clean it up.

There's no installation. Simply change into the directory and run the
neat_demo.py script to try it out. This will open a Tk window and draw a
rotating cube. Woo!
